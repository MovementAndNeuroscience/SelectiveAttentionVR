This can be used to verify that Late Latching is working as intended via log entries in Development builds. Currently requires Unity 2020.3.28f1 or higher, and will be available in a future release of 2021.2+,- Add optional support for Symmetric Projection on Quest 2 when using Vulkan and Multiview. This can improve GPU performance when using Multiview due to more common workloads between the left and right eye,### Changed,- Multiview (Quest), and Single Pass Instanced (PC) are now the default stereo rendering modes in Unity 2021.2 and higher,### Fixed,- Android Minimum API Level was always being forced to 23 when Oculus Android was enabled. Now it's only set to 23 if it's currently less than 23"
